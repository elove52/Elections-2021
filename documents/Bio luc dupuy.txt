My name is Luc Dupuy and this is my 4th year living in the building. I am a 4th year Computer Science student at Ryerson and am planning to graduate after this semester! When I am not studying I like to do/teach archery, read, and play video games and chess with my friends! Neill-Wycik has become a home away from home for me (it's also how my parents met!) and I hope I can give back to the community and help improve the little things that I think will go a long way.
